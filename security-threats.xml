    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a security threat analysis for the Routing
      Protocol for Low-power and lossy networks (RPL, ROLL). The development
      builds upon previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments
      to the issues and constraints specific to low-power and lossy networks.
      A systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security
      threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application specific and are
      addressed in relevant applicability statements.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>In recent times, networked electronic devices have found an
      increasing number of applications in various fields. Yet, for reasons
      ranging from operational application to economics, these wired and
      wireless devices are often supplied with minimum physical resources; the
      constraints include those on computational resources (RAM, clock speed,
      storage), communication resources (duty cycle, packet size, etc.), but
      also form factors that may rule out user access interfaces (e.g., the
      housing of a small stick-on switch), or simply safety considerations
      (e.g., with gas meters). As a consequence, the resulting networks are
      more prone to loss of traffic and other vulnerabilities. The
      proliferation of these low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), however, are
      drawing efforts to examine and address their potential networking
      challenges. Securing the establishment and maintenance of network
      connectivity among these deployed devices becomes one of these key
      challenges.</t>

      <t>This document presents a threat analysis for securing the Routing
      Protocol for LLNs (RPL). The process requires two steps. First, the
      analysis will be used to identify pertinent security issues. The second
      step is to identify necessary countermeasures to secure RPL. As there
      are multiple ways to solve the problem and the specific tradeoffs are
      deployment specific, the specific countermeasure to be used is detailed
      in applicability statements.</t>

      <t>This document uses [IS07498-2] model, which describes Authentication,
      Access Control, Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and
      Non-Repudiation security services and to which Availability is added.</t>

      <t>All of this document concerns itself with securing the control plane
      traffic. As such it does not address authorization or authentication of
      application traffic.  RPL uses multicast as part of it's protocol, and
      therefore mechanisms which RPL uses to secure this traffic MAY be applicable
      to MPL control traffic as well:  the important part is that the threats
      are similiar.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Relationship to other documents">
      <t>
        ROLL has specified a set of routing protocols for Lossy and Low-resource
        Networks (LLN) <xref target="RFC6550" />.
        A number of applicability texts describes a subset of these protocols
        and the conditions which make the subset the correct choice. The text
        recommends and motivates the accompanying parameter value ranges.
        Multiple applicability domains are recognized including: Building and Home,
        and Advanced Metering Infrastructure.   The applicability domains distinguish
        themselves in the way they are operated, their performance requirements, and the
        most probable network
        structures. Each applicability statement identifies the distinguishing
        properties according to a common set of subjects described in as many
        sections.
      </t>
      <t>
        The common set of security threats are herein are referred to by
        the applicability statements, and that series of documents
        describes the preferred security settings and solutions within the
        applicability statement conditions. This applicability statements may
        recommend more light weight security solutions and specify the conditions
        under which these solutions are appropriate.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>This document adopts the terminology defined in <xref
      target="RFC6550"/>, in <xref target="RFC4949"/>, and in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-roll-terminology"/>.</t>

      <t>The terms control plane and forwarding plane are used consistently
      with section 1 of <xref target="RFC6192"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="cons-on-roll-sec" title="Considerations on RPL Security">
      <t>Routing security, in essence, ensures that the routing protocol
      operates correctly. It entails implementing measures to ensure
      controlled state changes on devices and network elements, both based on
      external inputs (received via communications) or internal inputs
      (physical security of device itself and parameters maintained by the
      device, including, e.g., clock). State changes would thereby involve not
      only authorization of injector's actions, authentication of injectors,
      and potentially confidentiality of routing data, but also proper order
      of state changes through timeliness, since seriously delayed state
      changes, such as commands or updates of routing tables, may negatively
      impact system operation. A security assessment can therefore begin with a
      focus on the assets <xref target="RFC4949"/> that may be the target of
      the state changes and the access points in terms of interfaces and
      protocol exchanges through which such changes may occur. In the case of
      routing security, the focus is directed towards the elements associated
      with the establishment and maintenance of network connectivity.</t>

      <t>This section sets the stage for the development of the analysis by
      applying the systematic approach proposed in <xref
      target="Myagmar2005"/> to the routing security, while also drawing
      references from other reviews and assessments found in the literature,
      particularly, <xref target="RFC4593"/> and <xref target="Karlof2003"/>.
      The subsequent subsections begin with a focus on the elements of a
      generic routing process that is used to establish routing assets and
      points of access to the routing functionality. Next, the <xref
      target="ISO.7498-2.1988"/> security model is briefly described. Then,
      consideration is given to issues specific to or amplified in LLNs. This
      section concludes with the formulation of a set of security objectives
      for RPL.</t>

      <section anchor="routing-assets"
               title="Routing Assets and Points of Access">
        <t>An asset is an important system resource (including information,
        process, or physical resource), the access to, corruption or loss of
        which adversely affects the system. In the control plane context, an
        asset is information about the network, processes used to manage and
        manipulate this data, and the physical devices on which this data is
        stored and manipulated. The corruption or loss of these assets may
        adversely impact the control plane of the network. Within the same
        context, a point of access is an interface or protocol that
        facilitates interaction between control plane assets. Identifying
        these assets and points of access will provide a basis for enumerating
        the attack surface of the control plane.</t>

        <t>A level-0 data flow diagram <xref target="Yourdon1979"/> is used
        here to identify the assets and points of access within a generic
        routing process. The use of a data flow diagram allows for a clear and
        concise model of the way in which routing nodes interact and process
        information, and hence provides a context for threats and attacks. The
        goal of the model is to be as detailed as possible so that
        corresponding assets, points of access, and process in an individual
        routing protocol can be readily identified.</t>

        <t><xref target="Fig1"/> shows that nodes participating in the routing
        process transmit messages to discover neighbors and to exchange
        routing information; routes are then generated and stored, which may
        be maintained in the form of the protocol forwarding table. The nodes
        use the derived routes for making forwarding decisions.</t>

          </list>A focus on the above list of assets and points of access
        enables a more directed assessment of routing security; for example,
        it is readily understood that some routing attacks are in the form of
        attempts to misrepresent routing topology. Indeed, the intention of
        the security threat analysis is to be comprehensive. Hence, some of
        the discussion which follows is associated with assets and points of
        access that are not directly related to routing protocol design but
        nonetheless provided for reference since they do have direct
        consequences on the security of routing.</t>

        <t>At the conceptual level, security within an information system in
        general and applied to RPL; in particular is concerned with the primary
        issues of authentication, access control, data confidentiality, data
        integrity, and non-repudiation. In the context of RPL</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Authentication"><vspace/>Authentication involves the
            mutual authentication of the routing peers prior to exchanging
            route information (i.e., peer authentication) as well as ensuring
            that the source of the route data is from the peer (i.e., data
            origin authentication). <xref target="RFC5548"/> points out that
            LLNs can be drained by unauthenticated peers before configuration.
            <xref target="RFC5673"/> requires availability of open and
            untrusted side channels for new joiners, and it requires strong
            and automated authentication so that networks can automatically
            accept or reject new joiners.</t>

            <t hangText="Access Control"><vspace/>Access Control provides
            protection against unauthorized use of the asset, and deals with
            the authorization of a node.</t>

            <t hangText="Confidentiality"><vspace/>Confidentiality involves
            the protection of routing information as well as routing neighbor
            maintenance exchanges so that only authorized and intended network
            entities may view or access it. Because LLNs are most commonly
            found on a publicly accessible shared medium, e.g., air or wiring
            in a building, and sometimes formed ad hoc, confidentiality also
            extends to the neighbor state and database information within the
            routing device since the deployment of the network creates the
            potential for unauthorized access to the physical devices
            themselves.</t>

            <t hangText="Integrity"><vspace/>Integrity entails the protection
            of routing information and routing neighbor maintenance exchanges,
            as well as derived information maintained in the database, from
            unauthorized modification, insertions, deletions or replays. to be
            addressed beyond the routing protocol.</t>

            <t hangText="Non-repudiation"><vspace/>Non-repudiation is the
            assurance that the transmission and/or reception of a message
            cannot later be denied. The service of non-repudiation applies
            after-the-fact and thus relies on the logging or other capture of
            on-going message exchanges and signatures. Applied to routing,
            non-repudiation is not an issue because it does not apply to
            routing protocols, which are machine-to-machine protocols.
            Further, with the LLN application domains as described in <xref
            target="RFC5867"/> and <xref target="RFC5548"/>, proactive
            measures are much more critical than retrospective protections.
            Finally, given the significant practical limits to on-going
            routing transaction logging and storage and individual device
            digital signature verification for each exchange, non-repudiation
            in the context of routing is an unsupportable burden that bears no
            further considered as an RPL security issue.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It is recognized that, besides those security issues captured in
        the ISO 7498-2 model, availability, is a security requirement:<list
            hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Availability"><vspace/>Availability ensures that
            routing information exchanges and forwarding services need to be
            available when they are required for the functioning of the
            serving network. Availability will apply to maintaining efficient
            and correct operation of routing and neighbor discovery exchanges
            (including needed information) and forwarding services so as not
            to impair or limit the network's central traffic flow function</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>It should be emphasized here that for RPL security the above
        requirements must be complemented by the proper security policies and
        enforcement mechanisms to ensure that security objectives are met by a
        given RPL implementation.</t>

      <section anchor="roll-issues"
               title="Issues Specific to or Amplified in LLNs">
        <t>The requirements work detailed in Urban Requirements (<xref target="RFC5548"/>),
        Industrial Requirements (<xref target="RFC5673"/>),
        Home Automation (<xref target="RFC5826"/>, and
        Building Automation (<xref target="RFC5867"/>) have identified
        specific issues and constraints of routing in LLNs.
        The following is a list of observations from those requirements and
        evaluation of their impact on routing security considerations.</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t
            hangText="Limited energy, memory, and processing node resources"><vspace/>As
            a consequence of these constraints, there is an even more critical
            need than usual for a careful study of trade-offs on which and
            what level of security services are to be afforded during the
            system design process. The chosen security mechanisms also needs
            to work within these constraints. Synchronization of security
            states with sleepy nodes is yet another issue.</t>

            <t hangText="Large scale of rolled out network"><vspace/>The
            possibly numerous nodes to be deployed make manual on-site
            configuration unlikely. For example, an urban deployment can see
            several hundreds of thousands of nodes being installed by many
            installers with a low level of expertise. Nodes may be installed
            and not activated for many years, and additional nodes may be
            added later on, which may be from old inventory. The lifetime of
            the network is measured in decades, and this complicates the
            operation of key management.</t>

            <t hangText="Autonomous operations"><vspace/>Self-forming and
            self-organizing are commonly prescribed requirements of LLNs. In
            other words, a routing protocol designed for LLNs needs to contain
            elements of ad hoc networking and in most cases cannot rely on
            manual configuration for initialization or local filtering rules.
            Network topology/ownership changes, partitioning or merging, as
            well as node replacement, can all contribute to complicating the
            operations of key management.</t>

            <t hangText="Highly directional traffic"><vspace/>Some types of
            LLNs see a high percentage of their total traffic traverse between
            the nodes and the LLN Border Routers (LBRs) where the LLNs connect
            to non-LLNs. The special routing status of and the greater volume
            of traffic near the LBRs have routing security consequences as a
            higher valued attack target. In fact, when Point-to-MultiPoint
            (P2MP) and MultiPoint-to-Point (MP2P) traffic represents a
            majority of the traffic, routing attacks consisting of advertising
            incorrect preferred routes can cause serious damage.</t>

            <t>While it might seem that nodes higher up in the cyclic graph
            (i.e. those with lower rank) should be secured in a stronger
            fashion, it is not in general easy to predict which nodes will
            occupy those positions until after deployment. Issues of
            redundancy and inventory control suggests that any node might wind
            up in such a sensitive attack position, so all nodes need to be
            equally secure.</t>

            <t>In addition, even if it were possible to predict which nodes
            will occupy positions of lower rank and provision them with
            stronger security mechanisms, in the absense of a strong
            authorization model, any node could advertise an incorrect
            preferred route.</t>

            <t
            hangText="Unattended locations and limited physical security"><vspace/>Many
            applications have the nodes deployed in unattended or remote
            locations; furthermore, the nodes themselves are often built with
            minimal physical protection. These constraints lower the barrier
            of accessing the data or security material stored on the nodes
            through physical means.</t>

            <t hangText="Support for mobility"><vspace/>On the one hand, only
            a limited number of applications require the support of mobile
            nodes, e.g., a home LLN that includes nodes on wearable health
            care devices or an industry LLN that includes nodes on cranes and
            vehicles. On the other hand, if a routing protocol is indeed used
            in such applications, it will clearly need to have corresponding
            security mechanisms.</t>

            <t>Additionally nodes may appear to move from one side of a wall
            to another without any actual motion involved, the result of
            changes to electromagnetic properties, such as opening and closing
            of a metal door.</t>

            <t hangText="Support for multicast and anycast"><vspace/>Support
            for multicast and anycast is called out chiefly for large-scale
            networks. Since application of these routing mechanisms in
            autonomous operations of many nodes is new, the consequence on
            security requires careful consideration.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The above list considers how an LLN's physical constraints, size,
        operations, and variety of application areas may impact security.
        However, it is the combinations of these factors that particularly
        stress the security concerns. For instance, securing routing for a
        large number of autonomous devices that are left in unattended
        locations with limited physical security presents challenges that are
        not found in the common circumstance of administered networked
        routers. The following subsection sets up the security objectives for
        the routing protocol designed by the ROLL WG.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="roll-objs" title="RPL Security Objectives">
        <t>This subsection applies the ISO 7498-2 model to routing assets and
        access points, taking into account the LLN issues, to develop a set of
        RPL security objectives.</t>

        <t>Since the fundamental function of a routing protocol is to build
        routes for forwarding packets, it is essential to ensure that: <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>routing/topology information integrity remains intact during
            transfer and in storage;</t>

            <t>routing/topology information is used by authorized
            entities;</t>

            <t>routing/topology information is available when needed.</t>
          </list> In conjunction, it is necessary to be assured that <list
            style="symbols">
            <t>authorized peers authenticate themselves during the routing
            neighbor discovery process;</t>

            <t>the routing/topology information received is generated
            according to the protocol design.</t>
          </list> However, when trust cannot be fully vested through
        authentication of the principals alone, i.e., concerns of insider
        attack, assurance of the truthfulness and timeliness of the received
        routing/topology information is necessary. With regard to
        confidentiality, protecting the routing/topology information from
        unauthorized exposure may be desirable in certain cases but is in
        itself less pertinent in general to the routing function.</t>

        <t>One of the main problems of synchronizing security states of sleepy
        nodes, as listed in the last subsection, lies in difficulties in
        authentication; these nodes may not have received in time the most
        recent update of security material. Similarly, the issues of minimal
        manual configuration, prolonged rollout and delayed addition of nodes,
        and network topology changes also complicate key management. Hence,
        routing in LLNs needs to bootstrap the authentication process and
        allow for flexible expiration scheme of authentication
        credentials.</t>

        <t>The vulnerability brought forth by some special-function nodes,
        e.g., LBRs, requires the assurance, particularly in a security
        context, <list style="symbols">
            <t>of the availability of communication channels and node
            resources;</t>

            <t>that the neighbor discovery process operates without
            undermining routing availability.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>There are other factors which are not part of RPL but directly
        affecting its function. These factors include weaker barrier of
        accessing the data or security material stored on the nodes through
        physical means; therefore, the internal and external interfaces of a
        node need to be adequate for guarding the integrity, and possibly the
        confidentiality, of stored information, as well as the integrity of
        routing and route generation processes.</t>

        <t>Each individual system's use and environment will dictate how the
        above objectives are applied, including the choices of security
        services as well as the strengths of the mechanisms that must be
        implemented. The next two sections take a closer look at how the RPL
        security objectives may be compromised and how those potential
        compromises can be countered.</t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="threat-sources" title="Threat Sources">
      <t><xref target="RFC4593"/> provides a detailed review of the threat
      sources: outsiders and byzantine. RPL has the same threat sources.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="roll-threats" title="Threats and Attacks">
      <t>This section outlines general categories of threats under the ISO
      7498-2 model and highlights the specific attacks in each of these
      categories for RPL. As defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/>, a threat is
      "a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a
      circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security
      and cause harm."</t>

      <t>An attack is "an assault on system security that derives from an
      intelligent threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate
      attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade
      security services and violate the security policy of a system."</t>

      <t>The subsequent subsections consider the threats and the attacks that
      can cause security breaches under the ISO 7498-2 model to the routing
      assets and via the routing points of access identified in <xref
      target="routing-assets"/>. The assessment steps through the security
      concerns of each routing asset and looks at the attacks that can exploit
      routing points of access. The threats and attacks identified are based
      on the routing model analysis and associated review of the existing
      literature. The source of the attacks is assumed to be from either
      inside or outside attackers.  While some attackers inside the network
      will be using compromised nodes, and therefore are only able to do
      what an ordinary node can ("node-equivalent"), other attacks may not
      limited in memory, CPU, power consumption or long term storage. Moore's
      law favours the attacker with access to the latest capabilities, while
      the defenders will remain in place for years to decades.</t>

      <section anchor="authorization-threat"
               title="Threats due to failures to Authenticate">
        <section anchor="any-identity" title="Node Impersonation">
          <t>If an attacker can join a network with any identify, then it may
          be able to assume the role of a legitimate (and existing node). It
          may be able to report false readings (in metering applications), or
          provide inappropriate control messages (in control systems involving
          actuators) if the security of the application is implied by the
          security of the routing system.</t>

          <t>In other systems where there is separate application layer
          security, the ability to impersonate a node would permit an attacker
          to direct traffic to itself, which facilitates on-path attacks
          including replaying, delaying, or duplicating control messages.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="extra-node" title="Dummy Node">
          <t>If an attacker can join a network with any identify, then it can

          metering applications), or provide inappropriate authorizations (in
          control systems involving actuators), or perform any other attacks
          that are facilitated by being able to direct traffic towards
          itself.</t>

          legitimate nodes of the network.</t>

      <section anchor="confident-threat"
               title="Threats and Attacks on Confidentiality">
        <t>The assessment in <xref target="iso"/> indicates that there are

        all points of access. This threat results in disclosure, as described
        in Section 3.1.2 of <xref target="RFC4593"/>, and may involve a
        disclosure of routing information.</t>

        <section anchor="route-exch-expo" title="Routing Exchange Exposure">
          <t>Routing exchanges include both routing information as well as
          information associated with the establishment and maintenance of
          neighbor state information. As indicated in <xref
          target="routing-assets"/>, the associated routing information assets
          may also include device specific resource information, such as
          available memory, remaining power, etc., that may be metrics of the routing
          protocol.</t>

          <t>The routing exchanges will contain reachability information,
          which would identify the relative importance of different nodes in
          the network. Nodes higher up in the DODAG, to which more streams of
          information flow, would be more interesting targets for other
          attacks, and routing exchange exposures can identify them.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="route-info-expo"
                 title="Routing Information (Routes and Network Topology) Exposure">
          <t>Routes (which may be maintained in the form of the protocol
          forwarding table) and neighbor topology information are the products
          of the routing process that are stored within the node device
          databases.</t>

          <t>The exposure of this information will allow attackers to gain
          direct access to the configuration and connectivity of the network
          thereby exposing routing to targeted attacks on key nodes or links.
          Since routes and neighbor topology information is stored within the
          node device, attacks on the confidentiality of the
          information will apply to the physical device including specified
          and unspecified internal and external interfaces.</t>

          <t>The forms of attack that allow unauthorized access or disclosure
          of the routing information will include: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Physical device compromise;</t>

              <t>Remote device access attacks (including those occurring
              through remote network management or software/field upgrade
              interfaces).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Both of these attack vectors are considered a device specific
          issue, and are out of scope for RPL to defend against. In some
          applications, physical device compromise may be a real threat and it
          may be necessary to provide for other devices to detect a compromised devise and react quickly to
          exclude it.</t>

      <section anchor="integ-threat" title="Threats and Attacks on Integrity">
        <t>The assessment in <xref target="iso"/> indicates that information
        and identity assets are exposed to integrity threats from all points
        of access. In other words, the integrity threat space is defined by
        the potential for exploitation introduced by access to assets
        available through routing exchanges and the on-device storage.</t>

        <section anchor="manipul" title="Routing Information Manipulation">
          <t>Manipulation of routing information that range from neighbor
          states to derived routes will allow unauthorized sources to
          influence the operation and convergence of the routing protocols and
          ultimately impact the forwarding decisions made in the network.</t>

          <t>Manipulation of topology and reachability information will allow
          unauthorized sources to influence the nodes with which routing
          information is exchanged and updated. The consequence of
          manipulating routing exchanges can thus lead to sub-optimality and
          fragmentation or partitioning of the network by restricting the
          universe of routers with which associations can be established and
          maintained.</t>

          <t>A sub-optimal network may use too much power and/or may congest
          some routes leading to premature failure of a node, and a denial of
          service on the entire network.</t>

          <t>In addition, being able to attract network traffic can make a
          blackhole attack more damaging.</t>

          <t>The forms of attack that allow manipulation to compromise the
          content and validity of routing information include<list

        <section anchor="exhaust-resource" title="Node Resource Exhaustion">
          <t>A potential threat consequence can arise from attempts to
          overload the node resource asset by initiating exchanges that can
          lead to the exhaustion of processing, memory, or energy resources.
          The establishment and maintenance of routing neighbors opens the
          routing process to engagement and potential acceptance of multiple
          neighboring peers. Association information must be stored for each
          peer entity and for the wireless network operation provisions made
          to periodically update and reassess the associations. An introduced
          proliferation of apparent routing peers can therefore have a
          negative impact on node resources.</t>

          <t>Node resources may also be unduly consumed by attackers
          attempting uncontrolled topology peering or routing exchanges,
          routing replays, or the generating of other data traffic floods.
          Beyond the disruption of communications channel resources, these
          consequences may be able to exhaust node resources only where the
          engagements are able to proceed with the peer routing entities.

      <t>By recognizing the characteristics of LLNs that may impact routing,
      this analysis provides the basis for understanding the capabilities
      within RPL used to deter the identified attacks and mitigate the
      threats. The following subsections consider such countermeasures by
      grouping the attacks according to the classification of the ISO 7498-2
      model so that associations with the necessary security services are more
      readily visible.</t>

      <section anchor="counter-confident-atk"
               title="Confidentiality Attack Countermeasures">
        <t>Attacks to disclosure routing information may be mounted at the
        level of the routing information assets, at the points of access
        associated with routing exchanges between nodes, or through device
        interface access. To gain access to routing/topology information, the
        attacker may rely on a compromised node that deliberately exposes the
        information during the routing exchange process, may rely on passive
        wiretapping or traffic analysis, or may attempt access through a
        component or device interface of a tampered routing node.</t>

        <section title="Countering Deliberate Exposure Attacks">
          <t>A deliberate exposure attack is one in which an entity that is
          party to the routing process or topology exchange allows the
          routing/topology information or generated route information to be
          exposed to an unauthorized entity.</t>

          <t>For instance, due to mis-configuration or inappropriate enabling
          of a diagnostic interface, an entity might be copying ("bridging")
          traffic from a secured ESSID/PAN to an unsecured interface.</t>

          <!-- BULLSHIT? -->

          <t>A prerequisite to countering this attack is to ensure that the
          communicating nodes are authenticated prior to data encryption
          applied in the routing exchange. Authentication ensures that the
          nodes are who they claim to be even though it does not provide an
          indication of whether the node has been compromised.</t>

          <t>To mitigate the risk of deliberate exposure, the process that
          communicating nodes use to establish session keys must be
          peer-to-peer (i.e., between the routing initiating and responding
          nodes). This helps ensure that neither node is exchanging routing
          information with another peer without the knowledge of both
          communicating peers. For a deliberate exposure attack to succeed,
          the comprised node will need to be more overt and take independent
          actions in order to disclose the routing information to 3rd
          party.</t>

          <t>Note that the same measures which apply to securing
          routing/topology exchanges between operational nodes must also
          extend to field tools and other devices used in a deployed network
          where such devices can be configured to participate in routing
          exchanges.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Passive Wiretapping Attacks">
          <t>A passive wiretap attack seeks to breach routing confidentiality
          through passive, direct analysis and processing of the information
          exchanges between nodes.</t>

          <t>Passive wiretap attacks can be directly countered through the use
          of data encryption for all routing exchanges. Only when a validated
          and authenticated node association is completed will routing
          exchange be allowed to proceed using established session keys and an
          agreed encryption algorithm. The mandatory to implement CCM mode
          AES-128 method, is described in <xref target="RFC3610"/>, and is
          believed to be secure against a brute force attack by even the most
          well-equiped adversary.</t>

          <t>The significant challenge for RPL is in the provisioning of the
          key, which in some modes of RFC6550 is used network-wide. RFC6550
          does not solve this problem, and it is the subject of significant
          future work: see, for instance: <xref target="AceCharterProposal"/>,
          <xref target="SolaceProposal"/>, <xref
          target="SmartObjectSecurityWorkshop"/>.</t>

          <t>A number of deployments, such as <xref target="ZigBeeIP"/>
          specify no layer-3/RPL encryption or authentication and rely upon
          similiar security at layer-2. These networks are immune to outside
          wiretapping attacks, but are particularly vulnerable to passive (and
          active) attacks through compromises of nodes.</t>

          <t>Section 10.9 of <xref target="RFC6550"/> specifies AES-128 in CCM
          mode with a 32-bit MAC.</t>

          <t>Section 5.6 Zigbee IP <xref target="ZigBeeIP"/> specifies use of
          CCM, with PANA and EAP-TLS for key management.</t>

        <section title="Countering Traffic Analysis">
          <t>Traffic analysis provides an indirect means of subverting
          confidentiality and gaining access to routing information by
          allowing an attacker to indirectly map the connectivity or flow
          patterns (including link-load) of the network from which other
          attacks can be mounted. The traffic analysis attack on an LLN,
          especially one founded on shared medium, is passive and relies on
          the ability to read the immutable source/destination layer-2 and/or
          layer-3 routing information that must remain unencrypted to permit
          network routing.</t>

          <t>One way in which passive traffic analysis attacks can be muted is
          through the support of load balancing that allows traffic to a given
          destination to be sent along diverse routing paths. RPL does not
          generally support multi-path routing within a single DODAG. Multiple
          DODAGs are supported in the protocol, and an implementation could
          make use of that. RPL does not have any inherent or standard way to
          guarantee that the different DODAGs would have significantly diverse
          paths. Having the diverse DODAGs routed at different border routers
          might work in some instances, and this could be combined with a
          multipath technology like MPTCP (<xref target="RFC6824"/>. It is
          unlikely that it will be affordable in many LLNs, as few deployments
          will have memory space for more than a few sets of DODAG tables.</t>

          <t>Another approach to countering passive traffic analysis could be
          for nodes to maintain constant amount of traffic to different
          destinations through the generation of arbitrary traffic flows; the
          drawback of course would be the consequent overhead and energy
          expenditure.</t>

          <t>The only means of fully countering a traffic analysis attack is
          through the use of tunneling (encapsulation) where encryption is
          applied across the entirety of the original packet
          source/destination addresses. Deployments which use layer-2 security
          that includes encryption already do this for all traffic.</t>

        <section anchor="counter-remote"
                 title="Countering Remote Device Access Attacks">
          <t>Where LLN nodes are deployed in the field, measures are
          introduced to allow for remote retrieval of routing data and for
          software or field upgrades. These paths create the potential for a
          device to be remotely accessed across the network or through a
          provided field tool. In the case of network management a node can be
          directly requested to provide routing tables and neighbor
          information.</t>

          <t>To ensure confidentiality of the node routing information against
          attacks through remote access, any local or remote device requesting
          routing information must be authenticated, and must be authorized
          for that access. Since remote access is not invoked as part of a
          routing protocol, security of routing information stored on the node
          against remote access will not be addressable as part of the routing
          protocol.</t>

        Manipulation can occur in the form of falsification attack and
        physical compromise. To be effective, the following development
        considers the two aspects of falsification, namely, the unauthorized
        modifications and the overclaiming and misclaiming content. The
        countering of physical compromise was considered in the previous
        section and is not repeated here. With regard to misuse, there are two
        types of attacks to be deterred, identity attacks and replay
        attacks.</t>

        <section title="Countering Unauthorized Modification Attacks">
          <t>Unauthorized modifications may occur in the form of altering the
          message being transferred or the data stored. Therefore, it is
          necessary to ensure that only authorized nodes can change the
          portion of the information that is allowed to be mutable, while the
          integrity of the rest of the information is protected, e.g., through
          well-studied cryptographic mechanisms.</t>

          <t>Unauthorized modifications may also occur in the form of
          insertion or deletion of messages during protocol changes.
          Therefore, the protocol needs to ensure the integrity of the
          sequence of the exchange sequence.</t>

          <t>The countermeasure to unauthorized modifications needs to: <list

        <section title="Countering Overclaiming and Misclaiming Attacks">
          <t>Both overclaiming and misclaiming aim to introduce false routes
          or a false topology that would not occur otherwise,
          while there are not necessarily unauthorized modifications to the
          routing messages or information. In order to counter overclaiming,
          the capability to determine unreasonable routes or topology is
          required.</t>

          <t>The counter to overclaiming and misclaiming may employ: <list

        <section anchor="counter-sybil"
                 title="Countering Identity (including Sybil) Attacks">
          <t>Identity attacks, sometimes simply called spoofing, seek to gain
          or damage assets whose access is controlled through identity. In
          routing, an identity attacker can illegitimately participate in
          routing exchanges, distribute false routing information, or cause an
          invalid outcome of a routing process.</t>

          <t>A perpetrator of Sybil attacks assumes multiple identities. The
          result is not only an amplification of the damage to routing, but
          extension to new areas, e.g., where geographic distribution is
          explicitly or implicitly an asset to an application running on the
          LLN, for example, the LBR in a P2MP or MP2P LLN.</t>

          <t>RPL includes specific public key based authentication at layer-3

        <section anchor="counter-replay"
                 title="Countering Routing Information Replay Attacks">
          <t>In many routing protocols, message replay can result in false
          topology and/or routes. This is often counted with some kind of
          counter to ensure the freshness of the message. Replay of a current,
          literal RPL message are in general idempotent to the topology. An
          older (lower DODAGVersionNumber) message, if replayed would be
          rejected as being stale. The trickle algorithm further dampens the
          effect of any such replay, as if the message was current, then it
          would contain the same information as before, and it would cause no
          network changes.</t>

          <t>Replays may well occur in some radio technologies (not very
          likely, 802.15.4) as a result of echos or reflections, and so some
          replays must be assumed to occur naturally.</t>

          <t>Note that for there to be no affect at all, the replay must be
          done with the same apparent power for all nodes receiving the
          replay. A change in apparent power might change the metrics through
          changes to the ETX and therefore might affect the routing even
          though the contents of the packet were never changed. Any replay
          which appears to be different should be analyzed as a Selective
          Forwarding Attack, Sinkhole Attack or Wormhole Attack.</t>

        <section anchor="counter-byzantine"
                 title="Countering Byzantine Routing Information Attacks">
          <t>Where a node is captured or compromised but continues to operate
          for a period with valid network security credentials, the potential
          exists for routing information to be manipulated. This compromise of
          the routing information could thus exist in spite of security
          countermeasures that operate between the peer routing devices.</t>

          <t>Consistent with the end-to-end principle of communications, such
          an attack can only be fully addressed through measures operating
          directly between the routing entities themselves or by means of
          external entities able to access and independently analyze the
          routing information. Verification of the authenticity and liveliness
          of the routing entities can therefore only provide a limited counter
          against internal (Byzantine) node attacks.</t>

          <t>For link state routing protocols where information is flooded
          with, for example, areas (OSPF <xref target="RFC2328"/>) or levels
          (ISIS <xref target="RFC1142"/>), countermeasures can be directly
          applied by the routing entities through the processing and
          comparison of link state information received from different peers.
          By comparing the link information from multiple sources decisions
          can be made by a routing node or external entity with regard to
          routing information validity; see Chapter 2 of <xref
          target="Perlman1988"/> for a discussion on flooding attacks.</t>

          <t>For distance vector protocols, such as RPL, where information is
          aggregated at each routing node it is not possible for nodes to
          directly detect Byzantine information manipulation attacks from the
          routing information exchange. In such cases, the routing protocol
          must include and support indirect communications exchanges between
          non-adjacent routing peers to provide a secondary channel for
          performing routing information validation. S-RIP <xref
          target="Wan2004"/> is an example of the implementation of this type
          of dedicated routing protocol security where the correctness of
          aggregate distance vector information can only be validated by
          initiating confirmation exchanges directly between nodes that are
          not routing neighbors.</t>

          <t>RPL does not provide any direct mechanisms like S-RIP. It does
          listen to multiple parents, and may switch parents if it begins to
          suspect that it is being lied to.</t>

      <section anchor="counter-avail-atk"
               title="Availability Attack Countermeasures">
        <t>As alluded to before, availability requires that routing
        information exchanges and forwarding mechanisms be available when
        needed so as to guarantee proper functioning of the network. This may,
        e.g., include the correct operation of routing information and
        neighbor state information exchanges, among others. We will highlight
        the key features of the security threats along with typical
        countermeasures to prevent or at least mitigate them. We will also
        note that an availability attack may be facilitated by an identity
        attack as well as a replay attack, as was addressed in <xref
        target="counter-sybil"/> and <xref target="counter-replay"/>,
        respectively.</t>

        <section title="Countering HELLO Flood Attacks and ACK Spoofing Attacks">
          <t>HELLO Flood <xref target="Karlof2003"/>,<xref
          target="I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn"/> and ACK Spoofing attacks are
          different but highly related forms of attacking an LLN. They
          essentially lead nodes to believe that suitable routes are available
          even though they are not and hence constitute a serious availability
          attack.</t>

          <t>A HELLO attack mounted against RPL would involve sending out (or
          replaying) DIO messages by the attacker. Lower power LLN nodes might
          then attempt to join the DODAG at a lower rank than they would
          otherwise.</t>

          <t>The most effective method from <xref
          target="I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn"/> is the verify bidirectionality. A
          number of layer-2 links are arranged in controller/spoke
          arrangements, and continuously are validating connectivity at layer
          2.</t>

          <t>In addition, in order to calculate metrics, the ETX must be
          computed, and this involves, in general, sending a number of
          messages between nodes which are believed to be adjacent. <xref
          target="I-D.kelsey-intarea-mesh-link-establishment"/> is one such
          protocol.</t>

          <t>In order to join the DODAG, a DAO message is sent upwards. In RPL
          the DAO is acknowledged by the DAO-ACK message. This clearly checks
          bidirectionality at the control plane.</t>

          <t>As discussed in section 5.1, <xref
          target="I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn"/> a receiver with a sensitive
          receiver could well hear the DAOs, and even send DAO-ACKs as well.
          Such a node is a form of wormhole attack.</t>

          <t>These attacks are also all easily defended against using either
          layer-2 or layer-3 authentication. Such an attack could only be made
          against a completely open network (such as might be used for
          provisioning new nodes), or by a compromised node.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="overload-attack" title="Countering Overload Attacks">
          <t>Overload attacks are a form of DoS attack in that a malicious
          node overloads the network with irrelevant traffic, thereby draining
          the nodes' energy store more quickly, when the nodes rely on
          batteries or energy scavenging. It thus significantly shortens the
          lifetime of networks of energy-constrained nodes and constitutes
          another serious availability attack.</t>

          <t>With energy being one of the most precious assets of LLNs,
          targeting its availability is a fairly obvious attack. Another way
          of depleting the energy of an LLN node is to have the malicious node
          overload the network with irrelevant traffic. This impacts
          availability since certain routes get congested which: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>renders them useless for affected nodes and data can hence
              not be delivered;</t>

              <t>makes routes longer as shortest path algorithms work with the
              congested network;</t>

              <t>depletes battery and energy scavenging nodes more quickly and
              thus shortens the network's availability at large.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Overload attacks can be countered by deploying a series of
          mutually non-exclusive security measures: <list style="symbols">
              <t>introduce quotas on the traffic rate each node is allowed to
              send;</t>

              <t>isolate nodes which send traffic above a certain threshold
              based on system operation characteristics;</t>

              <t>allow only trusted data to be received and forwarded.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>As for the first one, a simple approach to minimize the harmful
          impact of an overload attack is to introduce traffic quotas. This
          prevents a malicious node from injecting a large amount of traffic
          into the network, even though it does not prevent said node from
          injecting irrelevant traffic at all. Another method is to isolate
          nodes from the network at the network layer once it has been
          detected that more traffic is injected into the network than allowed
          by a prior set or dynamically adjusted threshold. Finally, if
          communication is sufficiently secured, only trusted nodes can
          receive and forward traffic which also lowers the risk of an
          overload attack.</t>

          <t>Receiving nodes that validate signatures and sending nodes that
          encrypt messages need to be cautious of cryptographic processing
          usage when validating signatures and encrypting messages. Where
          feasible, certificates should be validated prior to use of the
          associated keys to counter potential resource overloading attacks.
          The associated design decision needs to also consider that the
          validation process requires resources and thus itself could be
          exploited for attacks. Alternatively, resource management limits can
          be placed on routing security processing events (see the comment in
          Section 6, paragraph 4, of <xref target="RFC5751"/>).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Selective Forwarding Attacks">
          <t>Selective forwarding attacks are a form of DoS attack which
          impacts the availability of the generated routing paths.</t>

          <t>A selective forwarding attack may be done by a node involved with
          the routing process, or it may be done by what otherwise appears to
          be a passive antenna or other RF feature or device, but is in fact
          an active (and selective) device. An RF antenna/repeater which is
          not selective, is not a threat.</t>

          <t>An insider malicious node basically blends neatly in with the
          network but then may decide to forward and/or manipulate certain
          packets. If all packets are dropped, then this attacker is also
          often referred to as a "black hole". Such a form of attack is
          particularly dangerous if coupled with sinkhole attacks since
          inherently a large amount of traffic is attracted to the malicious
          node and thereby causing significant damage. In a shared medium, an
          outside malicious node would selectively jam overheard data flows,
          where the thus caused collisions incur selective forwarding.</t>

          <t>Selective Forwarding attacks can be countered by deploying a
          series of mutually non-exclusive security measures: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>multipath routing of the same message over disjoint
              paths;</t>

              <t>dynamically selecting the next hop from a set of
              candidates.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The first measure basically guarantees that if a message gets
          lost on a particular routing path due to a malicious selective
          forwarding attack, there will be another route which successfully
          delivers the data. Such a method is inherently suboptimal from an
          energy consumption point of view; it is also suboptimal from a
          network utilization perspective. The second method basically
          involves a constantly changing routing topology in that next-hop
          routers are chosen from a dynamic set in the hope that the number of
          malicious nodes in this set is negligible. A routing protocol that
          allows for disjoint routing paths may also be useful.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Sinkhole Attacks">
          <t>In sinkhole attacks, the malicious node manages to attract a lot
          of traffic mainly by advertising the availability of high-quality
          links even though there are none <xref target="Karlof2003"/>. It
          hence constitutes a serious attack on availability.</t>

          <t>The malicious node creates a sinkhole by attracting a large
          amount of, if not all, traffic from surrounding neighbors by
          advertising in and outwards links of superior quality. Affected
          nodes hence eagerly route their traffic via the malicious node
          which, if coupled with other attacks such as selective forwarding,
          may lead to serious availability and security breaches. Such an
          attack can only be executed by an inside malicious node and is
          generally very difficult to detect. An ongoing attack has a profound
          impact on the network topology and essentially becomes a problem of
          flow control.</t>

          <t>Sinkhole attacks can be countered by deploying a series of
          mutually non-exclusive security measures: <list style="symbols">
              <t>use geographical insights for flow control;</t>

              <t>isolate nodes which receive traffic above a certain
              threshold;</t>

              <t>dynamically pick up next hop from set of candidates;</t>

              <t>allow only trusted data to be received and forwarded.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Some LLNs may provide for geolocation services, often derived
          from solving triangulation equations from radio delay calculations,
          such calculations could in theory be subverted by a sinkhole that
          transmitted at precisely the right power in a node to node
          fashion.</t>

          <t>While geographic knowledge could help assure that traffic always
          went in the physical direction desired, it would not assure that the
          traffic was taking the most efficient route, as the lowest cost real
          route might be match the physical topology; such as when different
          parts of an LLN are connected by high-speed wired networks.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Countering Wormhole Attacks">
          <t>In wormhole attacks at least two malicious nodes claim to have a
          short path between themselves <xref target="Karlof2003"/>. This
          changes the availability of certain routing paths and hence
          constitutes a serious security breach.</t>

          <t>Essentially, two malicious insider nodes use another, more
          powerful, transmitter to communicate with each other and thereby
          distort the would-be-agreed routing path. This distortion could
          involve shortcutting and hence paralyzing a large part of the
          network; it could also involve tunneling the information to another
          region of the network where there are, e.g., more malicious nodes
          available to aid the intrusion or where messages are replayed,
          etc.</t>

          <t>In conjunction with selective forwarding, wormhole attacks can
          create race conditions which impact topology maintenance, routing
          protocols as well as any security suits built on "time of check" and
          "time of use".</t>

          <t>A pure wormhole attack is nearly impossible to detect. A wormhole
          which is used in order to subsequently mount another kind of attack
          would be defeated by defeating the other attack. A perfect wormhole,
          in which there is nothing adverse that occurs to the traffic, would
          be difficult to call an attack. The worst thing that a benign
          wormhole can do in such a situation is to cease to operate (become
          unstable), causing the network to have to recalculate routes.</t>

          <t>A highly unstable wormhole is no different than a radio opaque
          (i.e. metal) door that opens and closes a lot. RPL includes
          hysteresis in its objective functions <xref target="RFC6719"/> in an
          attempt to deal with frequent changes to the ETX between nodes.</t>
